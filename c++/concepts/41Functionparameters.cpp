//Parameters and Arguments
/*Information can be passed to functions as a parameter. Parameters act as variables inside the function.

Parameters are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses.
 You can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma:*/

/*When a parameter is passed to the function, it is called an argument.
 So, from the example above: fname is a parameter, while Liam, Jenny and Anja are arguments.*/
